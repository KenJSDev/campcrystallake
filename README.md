# Camp Crystal Lake Website

### Languages / Protocols / Tools
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5
- Visual Studio Code, Git Hub

### Project Details
- This project is basically a playground for me to get familiar with Bootstrap.
- My current focus is entirely on design. I want the site to be visually appealing to both professionals and vistors.
- In the future, I may expand into functionality

## Focus Moving Forward
- I have no specific goals for this project at this time other than getting familiar with bootstrap.
- Once I am comfortable, may add functionality to the site but may also start a new project. It depends on what I learn and what ideas I get during the leanring process.
